What's Pysimulator 3000?
This is a simulator written in Python 2.7 using Pygame Library. It allows you to
simulate a 512 tracks hdd, and compare the perfomance of diferent scheduling
algorithms.

How to use this amazing Pysimulator 3000 ?

Executable: ./Pysimulator.py 

At the beggining you'll enter in the set up screen, in wich you'll be able to
modify and set certain parameters for the simulation.

	1.-To do so, click on any button and then you'll be able to write in the input box.
	2.-To finish input just press enter.
	3.- Clik on "ejecutar" brings you to the next screen. The graphic scren.
	4.- Now just ckick on any algorithm you want (you can choose more than one!!)
	5.- You'll see the information of the simulation at the bottom of the screen.
