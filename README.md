## Disk Scheduling Algorithms Simulator


This is a simulator written in Python 2.7 using Pygame Library. 
It allows the user to simulate a 512 tracks hdd, and compare the perfomance of different scheduling algorithms.

Dependencies:
=============
* [Python 2.7+](http://www.python.org/)
* [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/)

How to use it:
=============
    Open a terminal
    $ git clone https://github.com/farfanoide/simuladorHDD
    $ cd simuladorHDD
    $ python Pysimulator.py

At the beggining you'll enter in the set up screen, in wich you'll be able to
modify and set certain parameters for the simulation.

	1- To do so, click on any button and then you'll be able to write in the input box.
	2- To finish input just press enter.
	3- Clik on "ejecutar" brings you to the next screen. The graphic scren.
	4- Now just ckick on any algorithm you want (you can choose more than one!!)
	5- You'll see the information of the simulation at the bottom of the screen.
